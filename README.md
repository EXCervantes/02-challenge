# Horiseon Webpage - Challenge 1

## Description

This is webpage is created for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. with the purpose of allowing potential clients and anyone else to gain information about the company. The page details descriptions of what the company does as well as its fundamental values.

The webpage was created using a combination of HTML and CSS. Both the HTML and CSS have been refactored for ease of reading, debugging, and functionality.

HTML for this project was modified to contain semantic elements appropriate to each part of the code and page. Certain bugs have addressed such as linking the [Digital Marketing Meeting](assets/images/digital-marketing-meeting.png) image to allow for the use of alt text for the image. A missing ID was also added to properly link the "Search Engine Optimization" within the page.

The CSS has been optimized to remove the clutter of redundant code and organized to be more neat. Comments have been added to the CSS to specify what certain functions in the stylesheet need to do.
